# PathActivity-Android

  -I have interfaced Google Maps, and included poly lines and markers in the app.
  -This app uses a json file containing longitude and latitude which will be mapped in the app.
  -After the map is loaded in the activity we will parse the json file and plot it against google map.
  -The trip will be displayed using polyline shape and start, end points are denoted by markers.
  -After plotting the map will be centered and zoomed to display all the trip points.
